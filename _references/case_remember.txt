Class names MUST be declared in StudlyCaps (ie: PascalCase).

Class constants MUST be declared in all upper case with underscore separators.

Method names MUST be declared in camelCase.

This guide intentionally avoids any recommendation regarding the use of $StudlyCaps, $camelCase, or $under_score property names.
